Hello! I'm Enoch from Hong Kong! I created this website as a side project for those struggling to wrap their heads around maths concepts
such as graphs and probabilities! Feel free to mess around the website until you finally understand these abstract ideas :) Have fun!

## Features

My website has two main features, namely Graphify and Probavis.

- **Graphify:**
It takes in a mathematical funciton, then returns the corresponding graph. It is fully customizable, from the styling to the components of the graph, it is all up to you. You can also download the graph.
- **Probavis**:
It is an interactive animation that visualizes the concept of probabilities. You can choose the number of classes and trials to simulate a scenario, and alter the color of the blocks to your liking. It automatically spits out the percentage at the end.

## How it was made

This website was made using React and styled with Material UI. Other libraries and tools used include:
- React hook form and yup: For feature settings
- React-plot: For making Graphify
- HTML Canvas: For making Probavis
- Phosphor icon set

## Possible improvements

- Responsiveness of the UI
- More customization options and supported mathematical functions for Graphify
